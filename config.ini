description="The MunoPhone template is back, completely rewritten and with a fresh new look! As before, it lets your character access extra features in Practice Mode (like Tips, Patch Notes, and Frame Data), as well as helping you more easily program your character behind-the-scenes. NEWLINE To use this on your character, just use this Sandbert as your template instead of the official one! If you want to add the phone to an EXISTING character, you can do that too - just follow the included installation guide. NEWLINE Here's what's new to MunoPhone Touch, compared to the old MunoPhone: [ADD FEATURE LIST FROM NOTEPAD] NEWLINE Check out https://bymuno.com for some of the other stuff I do."
